# Honeygain Grapher Redesign (v1.19.3)
I redesigned the dashboard of [HoneyGainGrapher](https://github.com/chaos511/HoneyGainGrapher) to look much cleaner and took inspiration from Honeygain's native dashboard design. All other parts of the project are untouched, I have no idea how to use node :')

## Installation
Setup is exactly the same as the original [HoneyGainGrapher](https://github.com/chaos511/HoneyGainGrapher).

If you've already setup grapher and don't want to reset your stats, you can replace the files in the `www` folder with the ones in this repo. You can even do this while the server is running!
