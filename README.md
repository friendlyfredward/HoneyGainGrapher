# Honeygain Grapher Redesign (v1.19.3)
I redesigned the dashboard of [HoneyGainGrapher](https://github.com/chaos511/HoneyGainGrapher) to look much cleaner and took inspiration from Honeygain's native dashboard design. All other parts of the project are untouched, I have no idea how to use node :')

## Features
- Generates an hourly graph of your individual device earnings
- Displays a list of device earnings and when each device was last seen online
- Can show total traffic, referral, honey jar earnings and payouts for any given date range
- Export transactions to CSV format
- Clean, modern design inspired by Honeygain's official dashboard!

## Installation
Setup is exactly the same as the original [HoneyGainGrapher](https://github.com/chaos511/HoneyGainGrapher).

If you've already setup grapher and don't want to reset your stats, replace the files in your `www` folder with the ones in this repo. You can even do it while the server is running!
